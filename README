DBIx::SQLCrosstab version 1.10
==============================

Creates a server-side cross tabulation from a database

DESCRIPTION

DBIx::SQLCrosstab produces a SQL query to interrogate a database 
and generate a cross-tabulation report. 
The amount of parameters needed to achieve the result is kept to 
a minimum. You need to indicate which columns and rows to cross 
and from which table(s) they should be taken.
Acting on your info, DBIx::SQLCrosstab creates an appropriate 
query to get the desired result.
Compared to spreadsheet based cross-tabulations, DBIx::SQLCrosstab 
has two distinct advantages, i.e. it keeps the query in the 
database work space, fully exploiting the engine capabilities, and 
does not limit the data extraction to one table.

The companion module DBIx::SQLCrosstab::Format provides nicely 
formatted output in HTML, XML, YAML, CSV, xls, and of course as
several Perl structures (lol, loh, hoh). 

VERSION

This is the initial distribution. The module has been tested 
extensively in private, but of course the public scrutiny is 
different, so I expect to get some bug reports in a near future.
You may consider this code as Beta.


INSTALLATION

To install DBIx::SQLCrosstab type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

EXAMPLES
In the directory examples there are several files:
    - crosstab.sqlite   is a database in SQLite format
    - sqlcrosstab_example.pl is an example of how to set
             the initial parameters and get the results
             in several formats.
    - create_crosstab_innodb.mysql and create_crosstab_myisam.mysql 
         contain the sample database in MySQL format
    - crosstab_sample.html contains the database structure and
         description

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  DBI
  one DBD driver module
  Tree::DAG_Node

Optionally, if you want to produce YAML output, the YAML module 
should be installed.
Similarly, for Excel spreadsheet output, you should install
Spreadsheet::WriteExcel
