Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::SQLCrosstab.

1.17 11-Jan-2004

    New features
    ------------
    - Now the {op} parameter is an array
      reference, containing pairs of operator/column, so that
      now it is possible to perform 
      [ ['COUNT', 'id'], ['SUM', 'salary'], ['AVG', 'expenses'] ]
      in one query.

    Deprecations
    ------------
    - usage of {col_op} and {add_op} (and {op} as a scalar) are now
      DEPRECATED.

    Bugs fixed
    ----------
    - operator names may cause a syntax error when they become 
      column headers. Fixed.
    
    Changed functionality
    ---------------------
    - changed operator names (when they become column headers)
      to "x"operator (xcount, xsum, xavg, etc.) to avoid a name
      conflict with some DBMS engines. Thanks to Cyril Dréno for
      reporting this bug.
      
    - changed crosstab column names from "fldXXX" to "xfldXXX"
      to avoid possible clashes with some other SQL generators.

    - the main example (sqlcrosstab_example.pl) now
      creates multi-operation tables to test and demonstrate 
      the above change.    
    
    Examples and Documentation
    --------------------------
        - Changed example create_crosstab.sqlite to create_crosstab.sql92
      (it should work on any ANSI-SQL92 compliant DBMS)
      
    - Changed example table names to "xtab_*", so that
      users allowed to a single database can easily add these
      tables without affecting existing ones.
      
    - Added drop_crosstab.sql to remove the example tables easily.
      (Thanks to Mark Stosberg for all these ideas on the SQL examples)
      
    - New documentation available:
      an article at OnLamp http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2003/12/04/crosstabs.html
      and one at PerlMonks http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=313934
 
1.16 12-Dec-2003 (Experimental - Not released)
    - Raised pre-requisite. DBIx::SQLCrosstab::Format won't
      work with Perl versions earlier than 5.6.1. 
      Notice that due to this limitation the installation test will
      fail under Perl 5.6.0.
      Actually, the minimum requirement was like that from the 
      beginning, but I failed to notice it. Thanks
      to Cyril Dréno for reporting this bug.

1.15 12-Oct-2003
    - Added new methods:
          set_param()   to add or modify parameters after creation
          get_params()  to get the current parameters into a string
          save_params() to save the parameters to a file
          load_params() to load the parameters from a file
    - Added new examples and database diagram
    - Added new sample schemas
    - Fixed some documentation issues
